            (tuple) Tuple containing:

                (list): A list of trajectories generated from the environment.
                (list): A list payoffs. Each entry corresponds to one player.

        Note: The trajectories are 3-dimension list. The first dimension is for different players.
              The second dimension is for different transitions. The third dimension is for the contents of each transiton
